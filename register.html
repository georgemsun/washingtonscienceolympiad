					<p style="margin-top: 0">Science Olympiad is an international nonprofit organization devoted to improving the quality of science education, creating a passion for learning science and providing recognition for outstanding achievement in science education by both students and teachers. These goals are accomplished through classroom activities, research, professional development workshops and the encouragement of intramural, district, regional, state, national and international tournaments.</p>
					<p></p>
					<h4>There are many benefits to becoming a Washington Science Olympiad member:</h4>
					<p>Receive your own copy of the Science Olympiad Rules Manual (annually-updated description of events and parameters of competition). Whether you compete in Science Olympiad tournaments or not, use the rules manual to teach science ~ many schools have Science Olympiad classes. With annual changes, you'll have a great resource for students to learn and to love science.</p>
					<p>Membership grants you admission to a Washington Science Olympiad <a href="events.html#tournaments" target="_blank">regional tournament</a>. Currently, there are three tournaments to choose from (one in Northwest Washington, one in Southwest Washington, and one in Eastern Washington). Top teams from each regional tournament advance to the state tournament at no additional charge. Top teams from the state tournament advance to the national tournament at no additional charge. <em>No additional registration fee to compete; although teams need to pay their own travel and lodging expenses to attend tournaments.</em></p>
					<p>Members have the right to vote in Washington Science Olympiad elections and Board of Directors issues. This affords you the opportunity to shape the future of Washington Science Olympiad.</p>
					<p>Most important of all, being a member of WSO means enriching the education of students in Washington State, and opening young minds to the exciting world of science!</p>

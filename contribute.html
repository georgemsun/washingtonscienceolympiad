					<p>It seems that a new report is released daily concluding that science education must be improved in schools. Business leaders bemoan that fact that the organization of science curriculum and instruction does not provide the kind of support for science learning that results in deep understanding of scientific ideas and an ability to engage in the practices of science.</p>
					<p>We believe Washington Science Olympiad (WSO) engages students and changes their perceptions of science and scientists. Further, we believe that WSO encourages students to become self-regulated learners and offers them opportunities to dive deep into the areas of science that they are most interested in. Too many students in Washington State are suffering through boring, lecture-based, paper-pencil assessed curriculum that is turning students off to science. WSO wants to bring the Olympiad to every school and every student. We want to develop meaningful curriculum for our teachers and recognize academic achievement! Would you help us?</p>
					<p>Would you help us reduce the registration fees that cause many schools not to participate? Will you help us develop curriculum that supports our events? Will you help us establish scholarships for our students? Will you help us offer more summer camps for students and coaches workshops for teachers? If you will, then please donate today. We are a non-profit organization that can provide charitable donation forms so that donations will be tax deductible.</p>

					<p>Washington Science Olympiad is a volunteer-based organization. We rely on donations of time, money, and supplies to continue to offer all the services we provide. If you want to be involved with activities that directly impact our young people, we could certainly put you to work! You could work with us in a variety of ways including, (but certainly not limited to) helping at one of the many tournaments we sponsor each year, or maybe you could help us with the ever present office work! Perhaps you'd like to work with science educators at you child's school to work with a current team, or start a new team. If you're interested in helping bring new, fun and exciting science education to the young people of Washington State, then please join us! Simply click on your region on the map below to send an e-mail to that region's tournament director. Please provide you name, phone number, mailing address, and a brief description of what you'd like to help with. Your information will not be used for anything other than communicating with you about volunteering with Washington Science Olympiad.</p>

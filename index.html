					<p>Currently, more than 135 middle and high schools representing over 2,000 students in Washington are participating in the WSO. In 2013 alone, WSO had over 1,000 volunteers involved in reaching middle and high school students for science. The challenging and motivating events of WSO align with the Washington State Learning Standards as well as the National Science Education Standards. The events are designed to enhance and strengthen both science content and process skills. The National Science Education Standards hails Science Olympiad as an example that "illustrates the close relationship between teaching and assessment. The assessment tasks are developmentally appropriate for young children, including recognition of students' physical skills and cognitive abilities" (NRC, 1996, p 39).</p>

<h2 id="title">Health Sciences Building Reservations</h2>
<h2 id="subtitle">Science Olympiad at the University of Washington</h2>

<h1>Rooms Available and Reservations</h1>
<p><a href="http://depts.washington.edu/hsrr/matrix">Listing of all rooms</a> in the Health Sciences Building. RoomQ, an online request form, is used for reservations in this part of campus.</p>
<p><em>Lab spaces</em> are available, with two of 24 person-capacities listed in the room matrix. Keys to lab spaces can be picked up from Classroom Services in T291A during business hours, M-F 8am-5pm. Contact the Laboratory Services Manager, Christine Aker, at 206- 616-3260 or caker@uw.edu with any further questions regarding labs.</p>
<p><em>Special event spaces</em> can be reserved up to a <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/hsrr/policies/year-in-advanc">year in advance</a> through RoomQ.</p>
<p><em>Non-special event spaces</em> can be booked at any time but will not be considered until the <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/hsrr/policies/scheduling-timelines">quarter prior to the reservation date</a>.</p>
<p>For events falling outside of regular building hours exterior door unlocks will be scheduled by the reservation office.</p>

<h1>Room Charges</h1>
<p>Any <em>lecture hall, classroom, seminar room, conference room, or lab</em> found in the Health Sciences Building and in the Foege-South (Genome Sciences) building may be used without charge only if the installed AV equipment will not be used.</p>
<p>Installed AV equipment includes LCD projectors, microphones, PA systems, overhead projectors, slide projectors, or document cameras found within our rooms. In these spaces, own equipment can be supplied to opt out of such charges.</p>
<p><em>Special event spaces</em> are charged at an hourly rate with a minimum fee of 2 hours and a maximum of 4 regardless of your event's length.</p>
<p>For specific charges, contact HSRR at 206-543-0530 or hsbrooms@uw.edu.</p>

<h1>Public Events</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/sprogram/uuf-info/uuf-request-form/">Request for Use of University Facilities Form (RUUF)</a> must be completed and approved for events open to the public.</p>

<h1>Food Policy</h1>
<p>If food or beverages will be present, <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/hsrr/support/additional-event-guidelines">special event containers</a> must be reserved because existing waste receptacles found in rooms and throughout buildings are not fit to carry catering waste.</p>

<h1>Additional Custodial Charges</h1>
<p>Failure to return rooms to their original configuration or leaving spaces in conditions that require additional custodial work will incur charges billed to the budget of the renting group.</p>

<h1>Borrowing AV Equipment</h1>
<p>Students and student groups may check out AV equipment from one of the STF loan offices on campus. These are located in the RSO Resource Center in the HUB, in the basement of Kane Hall, and in the Health Sciences Building. Requests for equipment are made through the STF website.</p>

<h1>Cancellation Policy</h1>
<p>Events canceled within 6 to 2 weeks prior to the event date will incur a $35 charge. Events canceled within 2 weeks of the event date will incur a $50 charge. If your reservation is made within 6 weeks of your event date, you will be given a 2 day grace period to cancel with no cancelation charge; after these two days the cancelation policy will apply. Extenuating circumstances will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<h1>Inclement Weather Policy</h1>
<p>If inclement weather forces the University of Washington to suspend all operations, any events or meetings scheduled on the day(s) of the closure will be cancelled, along with any associated charges.</p>
